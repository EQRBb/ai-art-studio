  {
    question: "Do I really get unlimited image generation?",
    answer: "Yes! With our AI Studio, you can generate unlimited images. Create as many AI artworks as you want without any restrictions. Each generation takes approximately 30 seconds, and all your creations are automatically saved to your gallery for easy access and management."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a realistic generation time?",
    answer: "Most images are generated within 20-40 seconds depending on complexity and current server load. Our AI processes 30 inference steps to create high-quality, detailed images. Simple prompts may be faster, while complex scenes with multiple elements might take the full time."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I generate images in different styles?",
    answer: "Absolutely! Our AI supports various artistic styles including abstract, realistic, fantasy, cyberpunk, watercolor, oil painting, and more. Simply describe your desired style in the prompt, such as 'a cat in watercolor style' or 'futuristic city in cyberpunk aesthetic'."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of images can I create?",
    answer: "You can create virtually anything you can imagine: landscapes, portraits, abstract art, product designs, character concepts, architectural visualizations, and more. The AI works best with clear, descriptive prompts that include details about subject, style, lighting, and mood."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I write effective prompts?",
    answer: "Great prompts are detailed and specific. Include: subject (what), style (how it looks), lighting (mood), and details (colors, atmosphere). For example: 'A majestic dragon flying over mountains at sunset, fantasy art style, golden hour lighting, vibrant colors' works better than just 'dragon'."
